# newrelic-integration-e2e-action

End to end testing for newrelic integrations to ensure the integrations are correctly executed by the agent, and the service metrics and entities are correctly sent to NROne.

New Relic has two kinds of integrations:
- Custom made integrations (e2e testing still not supported)
- Integrations based on prometheus exporters

## Steps the of the e2e action

- It reads the e2e test descriptor file/s that must be passed as an argument to the action.
- For each scenario present on the descriptor:  
    - It installs the infrastructure agent & the required packages.
    - Launch services dependencies (e.g. a docker-compose ) if theyâ€™re required.
    - It verifies that required services are up & running
    - It creates a config file with the details in the descriptor. 
    - Adds a custom-attribute to the config:
        - Composed by the current commit sha + a new 10 alphanumeric-random digit on each scenario.
        - The tests will look for this label to fetch the metrics and the entities from the New Relic backend.
    - The runner executes the tests one by one, checking that metrics &/or entities are being created correctly. and if fails retries after n seconds.
    - If the test fails, it's retried after the `retry_seconds` (default 30s) and up to the `retry_attempts` (default 10) defined for the action. 
    - It stops & removes the services (if they are required).
    - If `verbose` is true it logs the agent logs with other debug information.
- The action is completed.


## Usage

Example usage:
```yaml

    branches: ["powerdns_e2e"]
  workflow_dispatch:
    branches: ["powerdns_e2e"]
jobs:
  powerdns-e2e:
    name: E2E tests for PowerDNS
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: checkout-repository

## Spec file for the e2e 
Example:
```yaml

  - description: |
      This scenario will verify that metrics froms PDNS authoritative
      are correcly collected.
    before:
      - docker-compose -f "deps/docker-compose.yml" up -d
    after:
      - docker-compose -f "deps/docker-compose.yml" up -d
    integrations:
      - name: nri-powerdns
        binary_path: bin/nri-powerdns
        exporter_binary_path: bin/nri-powerdns-exporter

          exporter_port: 9121
          api_key: authoritative-secret
    tests:
      nrqls:
        - query: "SELECT average(powerdns_authoritative_queries_total) FROM Metric"
      entities:
        - type: "POWERDNS_AUTHORITATIVE"
          data_type: "Metric"
          metric_name: "powerdns_authoritative_up"
        - type: "POWERDNS_RECURSOR"
          data_type: "Metric"
          metric_name: "powerdns_recursor_up"
      metrics:
        - source: "powerdns.yml"
          except_entities:
            - POWERDNS_AUTHORITATIVE
          except_metrics:
            - powerdns_authoritative_answers_bytes_total
            - powerdns_recursor_cache_lookups_total
          # additionals: ""
